## 💡 Feature Breakdown

### 1. Mobile-First Navigation

The header automatically switches to a hamburger menu on mobile devices, providing a seamless experience for smartphone users.

### 2. Smart Grid System

In the items section, we use a custom grid that displays **2 cards per row on mobile** and scales up to **4 cards on desktop**, ensuring product images remain large and clickable.

### 3. Dashboard Analytics

The dashboard provides a visual summary of total orders, pending tasks, and earnings using clean, card-based stats and a recent activity table.

### 4. Optimized Routing

Using Next.js App Router, the application uses folder-based routing with private folder structures (`_components`) to keep components separate from routes.
